Intended Age Group: 5–12 years old

IQ Stack Ltd. (“we,” “our,” “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of all players, especially children. Block Builder (“the Game”) is designed for children ages 5–12 and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play Families Program requirements.

This Privacy Policy explains how the Game handles information and what data is or is not collected.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users of the Game.

The Game does not request or access:

Names

Email addresses

Location services

Photos, camera, or microphone

Contact lists

Device files

Account creation or login

Purchases or payment information

There is no user registration, and no personal data ever reaches our servers.


2. Third-Party Services (AdMob Only)

Block Builder uses Google AdMob to display interstitial ads.

AdMob is configured with the following child-safe settings:

AdMob.initialize({
    requestTrackingAuthorization: false,
    initializeForTesting: false,
    tagForChildDirectedTreatment: true,
    maxAdContentRating: 'G'
});

This ensures:

G-rated ads only

No personalized ads

No tracking for ad personalization

No interest-based advertising

COPPA-compliant ad delivery

AdMob may automatically collect non-personal anonymous data, such as:

Device type

Non-precise location (approximate region)

Ad interactions

Crash or performance data

This information is used only by Google to deliver contextual ads and prevent fraud.
We do not access, store, or use this information.

3. In-App Review API

The Game includes the official Google Play In-App Review API, which allows users to rate the app without leaving the game.

No personal data is collected.

We do not see or store any information related to the review flow.

The API is fully operated and controlled by Google.

There are no external links, social features, or access to websites.

4. Children’s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

Because Block Builder is designed for children:

We do not collect personal information

We do not allow user-generated content

We do not include chat or social sharing

We do not allow personalized advertising

We use only G-rated, child-safe, contextual ads

We do not provide external links that children could open

If a parent or guardian believes that personal data may have been accidentally submitted, they can contact us at iqstackltd@gmail.com, and we will address the request immediately—though the Game is not designed to collect any such data.


5. International Users

Block Builder is available worldwide.
We do not collect or process personal data, but Google AdMob may process anonymous ad delivery data under its own global privacy standards, including:

GDPR (Europe)

CCPA (California)

LGPD (Brazil)

Since we do not collect personal information, no international data transfer is performed by us.


6. Security

Because we do not collect or retain personal data, there is no personal information at risk.
Google is responsible for securing any anonymous data collected by AdMob.


7. Your Rights

Since no personal data is collected:

There is no data to delete

No account to deactivate

No profile to access or change

No opt-outs are required

Users may disable ads personalization at the device level, though the Game already uses non-personalized ads only.
