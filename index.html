<h1>Privacy Policy for Block Builder</h1>

<strong>Contact Email:</strong> iqstackltd@gmail.com<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> California, USA<br>
<strong>Intended Age Group:</strong> 5–12 years old</p>

<p>IQ Stack Ltd. (“we,” “our,” “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of all players, especially children. Block Builder (“the Game”) is designed for children ages 5–12 and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play Families Program requirements.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users of the Game.</p>
<p>The Game does not request or access: names, email addresses, photos, location services, contact lists, account login information, device files, or payment data. No user registration is required.</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services (AdMob Only)</h2>
<p>The Game uses Google AdMob to display G-rated, child-safe interstitial ads. AdMob is configured with:</p>

<pre>requestTrackingAuthorization: false
tagForChildDirectedTreatment: true
maxAdContentRating: 'G'
</pre>

<p>AdMob may collect anonymous, non-personal device information to show contextual ads and prevent fraud. We do not receive or store this data.</p>

<p>Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<h2>3. In-App Review API</h2>
<p>The Game uses the official Google Play In-App Review API. This system does not collect personal data and is fully managed by Google.</p>
<p>The Game contains no external links.</p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy & COPPA Compliance</h2>
<p>The Game is designed for children and:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not collect personal data</li>
    <li>Does not allow social features or chat</li>
    <li>Does not allow personalized advertising</li>
    <li>Does not include external links</li>
</ul>

<p>If a parent believes their child accidentally submitted personal information, they may contact us at <strong>iqstackltd@gmail.com</strong>, and we will assist immediately—even though the Game is not designed to collect such information.</p>

<h2>5. International Users</h2>
<p>The Game is available worldwide. We do not collect personal data, but AdMob (Google) may process anonymous data in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and other international privacy laws.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect or store personal information, no personal data is at risk. AdMob secures any anonymous data it processes.</p>

<h2>7. User Rights</h2>
<p>Because no personal data is collected:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is no data to delete or modify</li>
    <li>No opt-out options are required</li>
